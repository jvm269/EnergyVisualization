# EnergyVisualization


Visualization Dashboard from the US Energy Information Administration detailing the usage of energy for each year. 

We'll use a line graph to detail change over time
We'll use a bubble chart to detail the amount of energy usage
We'll use a geo map to show areas of energy.

You will be able to navigate the charts my year, state or energy source
We will try to work with either the JS libraries of Apex or Victory along with d3 for visualization. 
We will use flask to serve our data to the homepage
